"""
src/auth/middleware.py
──────────────────────
Transparent token rotation middleware.

On every secured request:
  1. If the access token is valid and not near expiry → pass through untouched.
  2. If the access token is expired/missing BUT a valid refresh token exists
     with sufficient remaining lifetime → rotate silently:
       - Issue new access + refresh token pair
       - Set new cookies on the response
       - Inject the new access token data into request.state so downstream
         dependencies (CookieTokenBearer) read the fresh token, not the stale one
  3. If rotation is not possible (refresh expired, blocklisted, not in store,
     or on an auth management route) → pass through and let the normal
     dependency handle the 401/403.

Rotation threshold:
  REFRESH_MIN_TTL_SECONDS — minimum remaining lifetime the refresh token must
  have before we consider rotating. Below this the refresh is nearly expired
  and rotation would produce a very short-lived pair; better to let the user
  re-authenticate.

Routes excluded from rotation:
  AUTH_BYPASS_PATHS — the auth management endpoints handle their own token
  logic and must not be intercepted.
